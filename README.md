Project Title: SQL Syntax Validator Editor using Flex, Bison, and Python (Tkinter)

This project is a lightweight desktop application that allows database programmers to type SQL queries and validate their syntax using a GUI editor. It integrates a frontend editor built with Python's Tkinter and a backend parser built with Flex (Lex) and Bison (Yacc).

Features:
- Syntax checking for simple SQL SELECT statements.
- Highlight syntax errors in a user-friendly way.
- Integrated Flex+Bison-based parser in the backend.
- GUI built with Python's tkinter and scrolledtext.
- Displays success and error messages via popups and a status bar.
